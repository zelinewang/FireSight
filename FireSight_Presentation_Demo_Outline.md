# 🔥 FireSight: Real-Time Wildfire Intelligence Platform

> [!WARNING]
> **Historical hackathon artifact.** This document is retained for project history, not current product verification. The browser app uses independently fetched NASA MODIS and NOAA-20 VIIRS C2 feeds, does not use Open-Meteo, and shows an illustrative—not operational—spread heuristic. It is not production-ready. See [README.md](README.md) for current behavior.

## 🎬 **Demo Script & Talking Points**

### **Opening Hook (30 seconds)**
```
"What if you could see every wildfire on Earth right now, 
predict where they'll spread in the next 6 hours, 
and access this intelligence in 10 seconds on any device?

That's FireSight - and I'm about to show you live NASA satellite data 
from this morning."
```

### **Technical Demo Flow (5-7 minutes)**
```
1. QUICK SETUP DEMO:
   "Let me show you how simple this is to deploy..."
   [Show python -m http.server 8000 command]
   "That's it - production ready in 10 seconds"

2. USER INTERFACE WALKTHROUGH:
   "This is designed for emergency responders, not data scientists..."
   [Navigate through welcome screen, show guidance]

3. LIVE DATA FETCH:
   "Now let's get fresh satellite data from NASA..."
   [Click Update button, show progress bar]
   "15 seconds to process thousands of satellite observations"

4. FIRE EXPLORATION:
   "Each fire emoji represents a real satellite detection..."
   [Click various fires, show details]
   "Heat levels, satellite source, detection time - all real data"

5. PREDICTION VISUALIZATION:
   "Yellow circles show where fire could spread in 6 hours..."
   [Point out various prediction sizes]
   "Based on fire intensity, confidence, and wind factors"

6. MOBILE DEMONSTRATION:
   "Critical for field responders..."
   [Resize browser window or use phone]
   "Same functionality, optimized for mobile use"

7. GLOBAL SCALE:
   "This works anywhere on Earth..."
   [Switch to Australia or Global view]
   "Same NASA satellites, different regions"
```

### **Technical Architecture Explanation (3-4 minutes)**
```
"The innovation here isn't just the user experience - 
it's the architecture that makes this possible..."

[Show architecture diagram]

"Pure client-side means:
• No servers to maintain or scale
• Works offline with cached data  
• Deploys to any CDN globally
• Zero backend costs

But the real challenge was data access...
[Explain CORS proxy strategy]

Multiple fallback proxies ensure 99%+ uptime
Even if one proxy fails, others take over automatically"
```

### **Future Vision Explanation (3-4 minutes)**
```
"What you've seen is just the beginning...
Version 1.0 gives us the foundation, but version 2.0 
will revolutionize wildfire prediction..."

[Show AI architecture diagram]

"Instead of simple circles, we'll have:
• Wind-driven elliptical shapes
• Physics-based spread models  
• 95%+ accuracy predictions
• Real-time risk assessment

[Show advanced fire model diagram]

"This isn't just better software - it's better science.
Rothermel equations, computational fluid dynamics,
machine learning pattern recognition...

We're building the future of wildfire intelligence."
```

### **Impact & Call to Action (2-3 minutes)**
```
"This technology can save lives, but only if it's deployed.

We're not just building an app - we're building a platform
that any emergency service can use, any researcher can extend,
any community can benefit from.

It's open source, production ready, and scalable globally.

The question isn't whether this technology works - 
you've seen it working with live data.

The question is: how quickly can we get this into the hands 
of the people who need it most?"
