- **Visual**: Background image of wildfire from space or abstract fire visualization
- **Footer**: Challenge Buckets: üî≠ Sensing & Autonomy | üß† Systems, Strategy & Simulation

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Layout**: Large header with bullet points
- **Header**: The Growing Wildfire Crisis
- **Key Stats** (use large numbers):
  - 70% increase in wildfire frequency since 2000
  - $10+ billion annual damage in US alone
  - 4.5 million homes at high risk
- **Pain Points**:
  - First responders lack real-time intelligence
  - Communities need predictive insights for evacuation
  - Current tools are fragmented and complex
- **Visual**: Split screen showing wildfire destruction vs. complex dashboard

## Slide 3: Our Solution
**Layout**: Center diagram with features radiating out
- **Center**: FireSight logo/screenshot
- **Core Features** (in circular layout):
  - Real-time satellite hotspot tracking
  - 6-hour spread prediction visualization
  - Interactive 2D map interface
  - 15-minute auto-refresh
  - Mobile-responsive design
- **Highlight**: "Built in just 2 hours!"
- **Visual**: Screenshot of the actual application showing hotspots and spread rings

## Slide 4: Technical Architecture
**Layout**: Flow diagram showing data pipeline
- **Flow**: 
  1. NASA FIRMS Satellite Data ‚Üí 
  2. Python Processing (GeoJSON) ‚Üí 
  3. Web Application ‚Üí
  4. Leaflet (Interactive 2D Map)
- **Fire Spread Model**:
  - Formula: `Spread Rate = Base √ó Temp Factor √ó Wind Factor`
  - 6-hour prediction radius calculation
  - Simplified for real-time performance
- **Tech Stack Icons**: Python, JavaScript, Leaflet, GeoJSON
- **Visual**: Architecture diagram with tech logos

## Slide 5: Live Demo
**Layout**: Full screen demo placeholder
- **Text**: "Live Demo - Let's see FireSight in action!"
- **Demo Points** (speaker notes):
  1. Show interactive 2D map with US mainland view
  2. Click on hotspot to show details panel
  3. Show spread prediction rings
  4. Demonstrate hover interactions
  5. Show auto-refresh functionality
- **Backup**: Include QR code to live deployment

## Slide 6: Impact & Future
**Layout**: Two columns - Current Impact | Future Vision
- **Current Impact**:
  - Democratizes wildfire intelligence
  - Zero cost, no authentication

  - Secondary: #FFD93D (flame yellow)
  - Background: #1A1A1A (dark)
  - Text: #FFFFFF (white)
- **Fonts**: 
  - Headers: Bold sans-serif (e.g., Montserrat)
  - Body: Clean sans-serif (e.g., Open Sans)
- **Animations**: 
  - Subtle fire particle effects on transitions
  - Smooth fade-ins for bullet points
  - Interactive elements should pulse/glow

## Speaker Notes Summary
1. Start with urgency of wildfire problem
2. Show how FireSight solves real problems simply
3. Emphasize speed of development (2 hours)
4. Live demo is crucial - practice beforehand
5. End with vision and clear next steps
