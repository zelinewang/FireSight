# 🔥 FireSight - Hackathon Submission
**Making Wildfire Intelligence Accessible to Everyone**

## 🚀 **Quick Start for Judges (30 seconds)**

### **Run the Demo:**
```bash
# 1. Start the server
python -m http.server 8000

# 2. Open in browser
# Visit: http://localhost:8000/src/

# 3. Try the live demo
# Click "🔄 Update" to fetch real NASA satellite data
# Click fire emojis to explore details
# See yellow circles for spread predictions
```

### **Alternative Setup:**
```bash
./start.sh
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000/src/
```

## 🎯 **What This Demonstrates**

### **Problem Solved:**
Wildfire data exists but is locked behind complex GIS systems that regular people can't access or understand.

### **Our Solution:**
FireSight transforms NASA's scientific satellite data into something anyone can explore and learn from - no technical expertise required.

### **Key Innovation:**
- **Real-time NASA FIRMS integration** (MODIS & VIIRS satellites)
- **One-click data access** for the general public
- **Zero setup required** - works in any browser
- **Educational focus** - designed for awareness and learning
