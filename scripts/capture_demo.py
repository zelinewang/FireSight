ðŸ”¥ FireSight Demo Capture Guide
================================

To create demo materials for your presentation:

1. SCREENSHOTS TO CAPTURE:
   - Main 3D view with all hotspots visible
   - Zoomed view showing spread prediction rings
   - 2D map view
   - Info panel showing hotspot details
   - Empty state (zoom to ocean)
   - Error state (disconnect internet briefly)

2. SCREEN RECORDING:
   - Record a 30-60 second demo showing:
     â€¢ Initial load with 3D view
     â€¢ Hovering over hotspots (size change)
     â€¢ Clicking to show info panel
     â€¢ Switching between 3D/2D views
     â€¢ Manual refresh button

3. CONVERT TO GIF:
   Use online tool or command:
   ffmpeg -i demo.mov -vf "fps=10,scale=800:-1" -loop 0 demo.gif

4. DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
   âœ“ Test locally at http://localhost:8000
   âœ“ Verify all files are committed to git
   âœ“ Deploy to Netlify/GitHub Pages
   âœ“ Test deployed version
   âœ“ Share link in presentation

5. PRESENTATION TIPS:
   - Open presentation.html in full screen
   - Use arrow keys to navigate slides
   - Have live demo ready as backup
   - Test on projector beforehand

Good luck with your demo! ðŸš€
